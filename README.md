# WHAT
Dingfan's personal blog. 

Asyncly record some of the thinking process and learning notes during learning journey.

# HOW 
Thanks to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll), I can mainly focus on content rather than the tedious website implementation details. 

Thanks to [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy), I can have a proper styling without the need of manipulating CSS and HTML details. 

# WHY
- Continuous reflection is key to continuous success. 
- Practice makes perfect. Blogging is practice for technical documentation.
