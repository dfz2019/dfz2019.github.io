# What is this?
A project that will cost 10000 hours to master a course, whatever topic it is about. 

# How to achieve it? 
To achieve this goal, there is a list of items needed to be prepared before implementation:
- A goal to achieve
- A time recorder to record the time spent on achieving this goal
- A continuous (monthly / quarterly) reflection plan

# Latest update
Although this post was published in quite long time ago, I wasn't aware of what to do for the first step: `A goal to achieve` at that time. After several YOE in software engineering career, I figured out some key capabilities which requires dedicated training:
- Large-Scale System Design
- Cross Functional Communication
- Fast Learning
